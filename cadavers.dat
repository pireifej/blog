	"content": "Leonardo's interest in human anatomy can be traced back to the late 1480s, when he was court artist to Ludovico Maria Sforza, the ruler of Milan. On the 2nd day of April 1489, as Leonardo dated the first page in a new notebook now known as the Anatomical Manuscript B, the self-styled 'disciple of experience' began a projected 'Book entitled On the Human Figure'. Its 44 folios contain several exquisite drawings of a human skull."
